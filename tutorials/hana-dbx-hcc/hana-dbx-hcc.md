- An SAP HANA Cloud database
- You have completed [this](hana-dbx-create-schema) tutorial which creates a database schema for an SAP HANA Cloud, SAP HANA database.
- You have completed [this](hana-cloud-dl-clients-overview) tutorial which creates a database schema for an SAP HANA Cloud, data lake Relational Engine

## You will learn
  - How to open a SQL console, specify the credentials, and set the current schema
  - An overview of the functionality provided in the SQL console

---

### Open a SQL console
This step demonstrates how a SQL console can quickly be opened from within SAP HANA Cloud Central and how to change the SQL console's credentials and schema.

1.  In **SAP HANA Cloud Central** open a SQL console by selecting **SQL Console** in the left pane.  Notice that the SQL console is not associated with a database when opened in this way.

    ![open SQL console](open-sql-console.png)

    Additional SQL consoles can also be opened by selecting the **+** icon.

2.  This time select **Instances**, select a database, and choose **Open SQL Console** from the actions menu.

    ![open SQL console from an instance](open-sql-console-instance.png)

    Notice that it is now connected to the instance named `HC_HDB` as shown by the name of the tab and the connection label.

    ![SQL console connected to HC_HDB](sql-console-connected.png)

3. The currently connected user can be seen by executing the SQL statement below.

    ```SQL
    SELECT CURRENT_USER FROM DUMMY;
    ```

    ![Current user](current-user.png)


4.  If you wish to connect to the database using a different set of credentials, select the **Connect this SQL console to a different instance** icon, select the current database and uncheck **Use cached credentials if possible**.

    ![Change credentials](change-credentials.png)

    The Enter Credentials dialog will then ask for the new credentials to be used.

    ![change credentials](change-credenitals2.png)

    You can also use the following SQL for an SAP HANA database to change the connected user.

    ```SQL
    CONNECT USER1 PASSWORD Password1;
    SELECT CURRENT_USER FROM DUMMY;
    ```

    ![Change credentials using SQL](change-credentials-sql.png)

    The SQL to view the current user for a data lake Relational Engine is shown below.

    ```SQL
    SELECT CURRENT USER;
    ```

    ![Show current user for a data lake Relational Engine](current-user-dl.png)

5.  The current schema can be set and viewed for a SAP HANA database using the SQL statements below.

    ```SQL
    SET SCHEMA HOTELS;
    SELECT CURRENT_SCHEMA, CURRENT_USER FROM DUMMY;
    ```

    ![Set the schema](set-schema.png)

    For data lake Relational Engine instances, the current schema can be set and viewed as shown below.

    ```SQL
    SET SCHEMA HOTELS;
    SELECT CURRENT SCHEMA, CURRENT USER;
    ```

    ![set the schema of a data lake RE](set-schema-dl.png)

6. Multiple light and dark themes are available.  

    Click on the SAP HANA Cloud Central settings icon.  Then select **Settings** > **Appearance**.  The default theme is SAP Morning Horizon. 

    ![available themes](themes.png)

### Execute SQL
This step demonstrates how to execute a SQL query, examine the statement help, view the query results, messages, and history tabs within a SQL console.  

1. Execute the following SQL statements.

    ```SQL
    SELECT * FROM HOTELS.CUSTOMER;
    SELECT * FROM NON_EXISTENT_TABLE;
    SELECT * FROM NON_EXISTENT_TABLE2;
    SELECT * FROM HOTELS.HOTEL_ROOMS_VIEW;
    ```

    The following error dialog appears.  Select  **Skip All**.

    ![SQL Execution Error dialog](error-dialog.png)

    Notice that there is an error marker beside the lines that could not be executed.  Pressing **Alt+E** will display further details and advances to the next error when pressed more than once.

    ![SQL results](sql-results.png)

    Notice that two result tabs are shown, one for each SQL statement that generated a result.

2. Results can be downloaded as shown below.

    ![download results](download-results.png)

    Options are provided on how to format the data.

    ![download options](download-options.png)
    
    Rows can also be selected and then copied to the clipboard by pressing Ctrl+C.

    ![](copy-results.png)

3. Place the cursor on line four and open the **Syntax Help** panel.

    ![statement help panel](statement-help.png)

    Notice that for SAP HANA Cloud, SAP HANA databases, links to the related documentation and details on the objects used in the SQL statement are shown.

4. Commonly used shortcut keys are listed below.  Try a few of them out.

    Action | Shortcut
    ------ | ------
    Add Comment Block | Ctrl+Shift+/
    Comment/Uncomment Line | Ctrl+/
    To Uppercase | Ctrl+Alt+U
    To Lowercase | Ctrl+Shift+U
    Go to Next Error | Alt+E
    Go to Previous Error | Alt+Shift+E
    Go to Line | Ctrl+L
    Jump to Matching Brackets | Ctrl+P
    Run All | F8
    Run Statement |	F9
    Text Completion | Ctrl+Space 
    Save to statement library | Ctrl+S

    >The shortcut keys may vary depending on the OS and browser used.

    For the complete list see [Common Keyboard Shortcuts for the SQL Console](https://help.sap.com/docs/hana-cloud/sap-hana-cloud-administration-guide/keyboard-shortcuts-for-sql-console).

5. Examine the **History** tab.

    ![history tab](messages-history-tab.png)

    Notice details for each executed statement are displayed, including metrics such as memory consumption. Statements can be quickly located using the search functionality. Selected statements may be inserted back into the SQL console or copied for further use.

    The columns can also be changed by selecting the gear icon in the right corner.
    
    ![history-tab-columns tab](history-tab-columns.png)


6. Examine the **SQL Console Settings**.  

    ![connection settings](connection-settings.png)

    * Execute the following SQL which is used to illustrate the result behavior settings.

        ```SQL
        SELECT * FROM M_SYSTEM_INFORMATION_STATEMENTS;

        SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SYS.TABLE_COLUMNS;
        SELECT * FROM TABLE_COLUMNS;
        ```

        Notice that only the first 1024 bytes from the column STATEMENT are displayed in the results view for the Blocked Transactions row.  These limits can be adjusted in the connection settings dialog.

        ![limit for large objects](settings-result3.png)

        Notice that over 6000 rows are in TABLE_COLUMNS.

        ![one thousand row limit](settings-result1.png)

        The first 1000 are displayed.

        ![one thousand row limit](settings-result2.png)

    * Execute the following SQL which is used to illustrate the result display display settings.

        ```SQL
        SELECT CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(7), RAND() * 10 FROM DUMMY;
        ```

        The below is the result when this setting is disabled.

        ![no formatting](no-formatting.png)

        Enable Result Format Settings in the settings.

        ![format settings](result-format-settings.png)

        The below is the result when this setting is enabled.

        ![result formatted](formatted.png)

7. Execute the following SQL statements.

    ```SQL
    SELECT HEXTOBIN ('48656C6C6F20776F726C64') BINARY_EXAMPLE FROM DUMMY;

    SELECT '{
        "name":"John",
        "age":30,
        "cars": {
            "car1":"Ford",
            "car2":"BMW",
            "car3":"Fiat"
        }
        }' AS JSON_EXAMPLE
        FROM DUMMY;

    SELECT '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <breakfast_menu>
        <food>
            <name>Strawberry Belgian Waffles</name>
            <price>$7.95</price>
            <description>
            Light Belgian waffles covered with strawberries and whipped cream
            </description>
            <calories>900</calories>
        </food>
        <food>
            <name>French Toast</name>
            <price>$4.50</price>
            <description>
            Thick slices made from our homemade sourdough bread
            </description>
            <calories>600</calories>
        </food>
        <food>
            <name>Homestyle Breakfast</name>
            <price>$6.95</price>
            <description>
            Two eggs, bacon or sausage, toast, and our ever-popular hash browns
            </description>
            <calories>950</calories>
        </food>
        </breakfast_menu>' XML_EXAMPLE FROM DUMMY
    ```

    Double tapping on a result will open a result viewer.

    ![SQL results](result-viewer.png)

8. The SQL in a SQL console is not persisted across browser reloads.  The SQL can be downloaded  and then later imported using the tools shown below.

    ![download and import](download-and-import.png)



### Statement library
The statement library is a convenient location in the SQL Console to store and retrieve frequently executed SQL statements.  It provides a place to store statements that are used frequently as to not type them in repeatedly.

The library is pre-populated with useful statements called ‘SYSTEM’ statements.

![Statement Library System Statements](statement_libaray_system.png)

You may also define custom statements that are only available to you. These are ‘USER’ statements.
```SQL
/*

[DESCRIPTION]

- Future guest check-ins across all hotels

*/

SELECT * FROM RESERVATION
    WHERE ARRIVAL >= CURRENT_DATE;
```

1. Save your custom statement, add a name and an optional description.
   
    ![Statement Library Create User Statements](save_custom_statement.png)

    Set the name to `All Future Check-ins`.

    ![Statement Library Save Statements](save_statement.png)

2. View your custom statement in the statement library
   
    ![Statement Library View User Statements](statement_libaray_user.png)

3. To run a statement, select one from the statement library and click the Run button.
   
    ![Run Saved Statement](run_saved_statement.png)

> It is also possible to export and import SQL statements directly to/from the file system
> 
> ![Import or Export Statements](export_import_statements.png) 
> 
> Files can then be shared using a version control system such as git.

User-defined statements can be edited. From the Statement library, select the desired statement, click open, and make the desired changes. Select Save to overwrite the previous statement.

### A few things to note
The SQL console within SAP HANA Cloud Central appears similar to the one within the SAP HANA database explorer but there are some differences.

* Opening the SQL console within the SAP HANA Cloud Central can be done much quicker than opening the full SAP HANA database explorer.

* The SQL console that you access from within SAP HANA Cloud Central can only connect to databases that are within the same BTP subaccount as SAP HANA Cloud Central. 

* The SQL console in SAP HANA Cloud Central has the following additional features

    * Ability to format results
    * Support for SAP Morning and Evening Horizon themes
    * Additional details such as time of execution, duration, rows returned, and success or failure in the history tab 

* The SAP HANA database explorer has some additional functionality

    * Persistency of SQL tabs and their contents
    * SQL debugging
    * Code completion of schema objects
    * Viewer for spatial and graph data
